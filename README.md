its a pokedex, it uses the PokeAPI, that's it

Had a lot of fun making this. The design was a pretty big challenge but Tailwind helped a lot.

## Known issues
* Pokémon with ID above 807 have incomplete information in the API, luckily, that's not my fault


## FAQ
##### Q: Is this is what peak project naming looks like?
##### A: Yes

## Links
* [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), CSS framework used
* [React](https://es.reactjs.org/), JS library used
* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) How on earth do you not know what typescript is?
* [PokeAPI](https://www.pokeapi.co) API where all information is fetched from. 
* [HybridShivam's pokedex](https://github.com/HybridShivam/pokedex-angular-app), I tried to contact this person but he wouldn't answer anywhere 
so I'm mentioning him here, I got some inspiration aswell as the images (his implementation allows to load images without needing to fetch a pokémon's sprites)
* [Nintendo](https://www.nintendo.com/) not sure who this guys are but I'm giving them some fame because I feel generous
